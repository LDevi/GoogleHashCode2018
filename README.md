Self-driving rides - Problem statement for the Online Qualification Round of Hash Code 2018

### What is Google Hash Code ? 
https://hashcode.withgoogle.com/overview.html

### Our implementation.
We decided to use the C ++ language to answer the problem. 
At first, we considered the problem of "self-driving rides" as the construction of a schedule.
Indeed, the number of cars, their positions but also all rices (duration + positions) are known in advance.


### The first try.
Certainly not the most optimized it is nonetheless a primordial step to understand the problem before going further : in the process of optimization.
The [first_attempt](https://github.com/LDevi/GoogleHashCode2018/tree/first_attempt) branch contains a simple algorithm.
